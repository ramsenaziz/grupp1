After each sprint all user stories that are in the \"Done\" column are released, which means team get paid. The user stories are then removed from Done column and a new sprint starts. \r\n\r\nEach team consists of:\r\n1 analyst\r\n4 developers\r\n1 tester\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n# It is allowed to re-assign people between roles, for example assign Developers to Analyst work, if that is decided when the day starts. The Analyst can do Test work and vice versa, but neither Test nor Analyst can do Development work.\r\n\r\n#Each team member can work between 1-6 hour per day.\r\n\r\n#Team members cannot start work if there is nothing in the corresponding column, so the day is wasted for that team member if there is nothing to do.\r\n\r\n#Team members can only work on stories that are in their respective column when the day starts.'),
